# DisableO5Keycards

DisableO5Keycards is an EXILED plugin made for making players on the server unable to upgrade their keycards to O5. The use of this plugin adds diversity to the game, as now players must actually think about which keycard they need/want to upgrade to.
- Yes, you can still open 106's doors without an O5.
- You can also open the Alpha Warhead Control Room without having an O5 keycard.
- When trying to upgrade to O5, the keycard remains on it's current level.
